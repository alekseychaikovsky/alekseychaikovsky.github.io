      Google.

      Previously I was a Software Engineer at <a href="https://staydomio.com">D≈çmio</a>,
      <a href="https://vts.com">VTS</a>, and <a href="https://mostro.com">Mostro.</a>

      Some of the things I enjoy include skiing. Maybe someday I'll live in Whistler. Traveling is something I will attempt to do
      whenever I have any extra time.
      Some of my favorite places I've been include New Zealand
      for an exchange semester, Iceland, British Columbia, and the European coast. I grew up playing PC games and never really stopped, I think my
      passion for programming was spawned from the map editors they used to include in all the games I played growing up.
